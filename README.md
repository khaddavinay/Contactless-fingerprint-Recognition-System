# Contactless-fingerprint-Recognition-System
This work presents a touchless fingerprint recognition system using smartphones
During the database collection, 15 subjects are captured using a mobile camera with a
complete database of 600 images. The minutiae-based approach is used on the enhanced
image obtained using segmentation, CLAHE, and adaptive thresholding.The verification
and identification is done by measuring distance between the features and comparing with
a threshold value.
